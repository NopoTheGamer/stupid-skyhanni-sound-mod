Some notes on the template:

- Currently, when adding configs you dont need to annotate with @Expose, and you have to annotate stuff with @Transient if you dont want it saved in the file.
- Objects annotated with @Module will get automatically registered.
- Feel free to ask Empa for help (`empa_` on Discord)
